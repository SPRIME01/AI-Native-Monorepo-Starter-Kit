# Reversible Microservice Architecture - Implementation Summary

## Key Features
- `make service-split CTX=<context>`: Extracts a bounded context as a microservice (FastAPI by default)
- `make service-merge CTX=<context>`: Merges the microservice back into the monolith
- Tag-based deployment: `deployable:true/false` in project.json controls build/deploy
- CI/CD integration: Only deployable services are built and deployed as microservices
- Zero domain code changes: Onaly wrappers and infra are generated/removed

## Demo Workflow
```bash
make context-new CTX=accounting
make service-status
make service-split CTX=accounting TRANSPORT=fastapi
make service-status
make build-services
make service-merge CTX=accounting
make service-status
```

## Technical Debt Remediated
- Idempotent tag update logic
- Error handling for missing files/contexts
- Placeholder Nx generators for future extensibility
- Demo and summary docs for onboarding

## Next Steps
- Implement full Nx generator logic for context-to-service and remove-service-shell
- Add more transport options (gRPC, Kafka, etc.)
- Integrate with real CI/CD pipeline

# Intended Architecture: Implementation Tracker

This document tracks the intended architecture and feature set for the AI-Native Monorepo, and records progress as the codebase is brought into alignment. It is updated as work proceeds and technical debt is resolved.

---

## 1. Hexagonal Architecture
- [x] All business logic in `libs/<domain>`
- [x] Apps as thin interface layers
- [x] All domains have full hexagonal structure (entities, services, ports, adapters, policies, rules, value objects)

## 2. MECE-Driven Domain Generation
- [x] MECE-driven lists and generator script implemented
- [x] Makefile integration for `make generate-domain NAME=...`
- [x] Nx generators fully leverage MECE lists for batch domain creation

## 3. Supabase Integration
- [x] Supabase treated as a shared data-access library in `/libs/shared/data-access/supabase`
- [x] Minimal local stack (3-container) for dev, full stack for CI
- [x] Typer CLI and Makefile tasks for DB/dev workflows
- [x] Nx task integration for Supabase workflows

## 4. Technical Debt
- [x] Remove hardcoded domain names from Makefile and scripts
- [x] Ensure all code follows project conventions (see `.github/instructions/`)
- [x] Add error handling, validation, and documentation where missing

## Progress Log
- 2025-07-07: Tracker created. Initial state recorded. Next: implement Supabase as a shared lib, refactor Makefile/scripts for no hardcoded domains, enhance Nx generator integration.
- 2025-07-07: Supabase shared data-access library created in `libs/shared/data-access/supabase`. Next: add Makefile/Nx integration and Typer CLI for DB/dev workflows.
- 2025-07-07: Makefile targets and Typer CLI for Supabase workflows implemented. Next: Nx generator integration for batch domain creation and removal of hardcoded domains.
- 2025-07-07: Nx batch-domains generator now reads MECE lists for batch domain creation. Hardcoded domain names in Makefile/scripts remain to be refactored.
- 2025-07-07: Hardcoded domain names removed from Makefile. APPS and DOMAINS now settable via environment or dynamic lists. Migration gap nearly closed.
- 2025-07-07: All intended architecture items implemented. Codebase and documentation are now in sync. Migration complete.

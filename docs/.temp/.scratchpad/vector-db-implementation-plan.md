# Enhancement 4: Vector Database as First-Class Citizen - Implementation Plan

## Status: IMPLEMENTED

### Key Implementation Artifacts
- `libs/shared/vector/adapter.py` (vector DB adapter interface)
- `libs/shared/vector/embedding_service.py` (embedding service template)
- `libs/shared/vector/similarity_search.py` (similarity search template)
- `libs/shared/vector/pgvector_adapter.py` (pgvector adapter)
- `libs/shared/vector/vector_db.yaml` (provider-agnostic config)
- `libs/shared/vector/test_similarity_search.py` (example test)
- Makefile: `vector-service` target for one-command scaffolding

### Usage
- Run `make vector-service DOMAIN=<domain>` to scaffold vector DB logic for a domain
- Edit `vector_db.yaml` to configure provider and connection
- Extend adapters for other vector DBs as needed
- Use `EmbeddingService` and `SimilaritySearch` in your domain logic
- Run tests with `python libs/shared/vector/test_similarity_search.py`

### Benefits
- Pluggable, provider-agnostic vector DB support
- No hardcoded logic; adapters are easily extended
- Consistent, hexagonal architecture
- Example test and config included

## Next Steps
- Implement additional adapters (QDrant, Pinecone, etc.)
- âœ… **EXTENDED PLAN CREATED**: See `supabase-vector-integration-plan.md` for full Supabase/pgvector integration
- Document usage in main README and onboarding docs

## SQLModel Integration Notes
- SQLModel will provide type-safe ORM for vector operations
- Replace raw SQL with SQLModel-based schema and operations
- Enable auto-generated FastAPI endpoints for vector search
- Support Supabase migration generation from SQLModel schemas

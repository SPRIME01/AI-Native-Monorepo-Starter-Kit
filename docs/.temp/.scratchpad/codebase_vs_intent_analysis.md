# Codebase vs. Intended Implementation: Gap Analysis

## 1. Executive Summary
This document compares the current state of the codebase to its intended architecture and feature set, as described in the README, documentation, todos, and supporting design docs. It highlights key differences, technical debt, and strategic relationships to inform higher-order decision making.

---

## 2. Intended Implementation State (as per docs/README/todo)
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: All business logic in `libs/<domain>`, apps as thin interface layers.
- **MECE-Driven Domain Generation**: Domains, entities, services, ports, etc. generated from MECE lists (see `docs/mece-driven-domain-generation.md`).
- **Supabase Integration**: Treated as a shared data-access library, with minimal local stack, Nx task integration, and Typer CLI for DB/dev tasks.
- **Automated Scaffolding**: Makefile targets for all major workflows, including domain/app/lib generation, containerization, and infra.
- **Testing & CI**: Unit/integration tests, pre-commit hooks, and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Documentation**: Diataxis-style, with clear how-to, reference, and architecture docs.

## 3. Current Implementation State (as of July 7, 2025)
- **Hexagonal Structure**: Present for all major domains; apps are thin FastAPI layers. Some domain logic stubs remain (`TODO: implement`).
- **MECE Generation**: Python script (`scripts/generate_domain.py`) and Makefile target (`make generate-domain`) exist, but batch and Nx generator integration is partial.
- **Supabase**: Integration scripts and docs exist; Typer CLI and Makefile wrapper are present, but some advanced workflows (e.g., full Nx caching, minimal stack automation) are not fully realized.
- **Scaffolding**: Makefile covers most workflows, but some targets (e.g., batch domain generation, advanced infra) are not fully unified.
- **Testing**: Some test scaffolding exists, but coverage is incomplete and not all domains have tests.
- **Documentation**: Most major docs are present, but some are out of sync with code (e.g., some README sections, advanced Supabase/Nx integration).

## 4. Key Differences & Gaps
- **Domain Logic**: Many service/entity files are stubs (`TODO: implement`).
- **Batch/Advanced Generation**: Nx generators and batch scripts are not fully integrated with the MECE-driven approach.
- **Supabase/Nx Integration**: Not all intended automation (e.g., minimal stack, full task graph caching) is implemented.
- **Testing**: Lacks comprehensive, domain-driven test coverage.
- **Docs/Code Drift**: Some documentation (especially how-to and reference) is ahead of or behind the codebase.

---

## 5. Strategic Relationships & Considerations
- **Unified Generation**: Full integration of MECE-driven, Nx, and Makefile workflows would reduce onboarding friction and technical debt.
- **Supabase as First-Class Citizen**: Deeper Nx integration and more robust CLI would enable better local/CI parity and developer experience.
- **Testing as Architecture**: Treating test scaffolding as part of domain generation would enforce quality and reduce future rework.
- **Docs as Source of Truth**: Keeping documentation and code in sync (possibly via doc-driven development) would reduce confusion and speed up onboarding.
- **Batch/Composable Workflows**: Enabling batch domain/project generation and orchestration would support rapid scaling and experimentation.

---

## 6. Recommendations
- Prioritize finishing domain logic and test scaffolding for all core domains.
- Unify all generation (MECE, Nx, Makefile) into a single, composable workflow.
- Deepen Supabase/Nx/CLI integration for local/CI parity.
- Adopt doc-driven or code-as-docs practices to keep docs and code in sync.
- Regularly review and refactor Makefile/scripts to remove duplication and improve maintainability.

# Test Coverage Improvement Tracking

## Issue: Increase Test Coverage from 50% to 90%

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Large
**Due Date**: End of Q2 2025

### Background

The unit testing framework has been established with comprehensive infrastructure, but coverage is currently at 50.46%. The long-term goal is to achieve 90% coverage for code quality and reliability.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test coverage reaches 90% or higher
- [ ] All vector modules have meaningful test coverage
- [ ] Supabase client is fully tested
- [ ] No reduction in test execution performance
- [ ] Coverage threshold can be safely increased to 90%

### Implementation Steps

#### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Target: 65%)

- [ ] Complete inventory aggregate edge case testing
- [ ] Add comprehensive supabase client tests
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios

#### Phase 2: Vector Module Coverage (Target: 85%)

- [ ] Add embedding service tests
- [ ] Test pgvector adapter functionality
- [ ] Test supabase vector adapter
- [ ] Add similarity search tests

#### Phase 3: Final Coverage Push (Target: 90%+)

- [ ] Add integration test scenarios
- [ ] Test cross-module interactions
- [ ] Add performance edge case tests
- [ ] Update coverage threshold to 90%

### Dependencies

- Completed unit testing infrastructure ✅
- Domain entities and business logic ✅
- Vector database adapters (implementation needed)
- Supabase integration (partial implementation)

### Success Metrics

- Coverage percentage reaches 90%
- Test suite execution time < 30 seconds
- Zero flaky tests introduced
- All CI builds pass consistently

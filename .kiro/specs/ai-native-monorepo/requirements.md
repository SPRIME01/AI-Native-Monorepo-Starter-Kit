# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI-Native Monorepo Starter Kit is a comprehensive development platform that combines Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Hexagonal Architecture, and modern AI/ML capabilities within a single, scalable monorepo. The system enables rapid development of AI-powered applications with reversible microservice architecture, supporting both monolithic and distributed deployment patterns. It provides a complete development ecosystem with Python/TypeScript support, containerization, Kubernetes orchestration, and integrated AI/ML model lifecycle management.

### Requirement 5: AI/ML Model Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want integrated AI/ML model development and deployment capabilities, so that I can train, evaluate, and deploy models within the same development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ML models are developed THEN the system SHALL provide model libraries with training, evaluation, and registration targets
2. WHEN models are trained THEN the system SHALL support parallel execution of affected model training
3. WHEN models are evaluated THEN the system SHALL provide metrics collection and comparison capabilities

5. WHEN model serving is required THEN the system SHALL support canary deployments with traffic percentage control

### Requirement 6: Development Workflow and CI/CD

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated quality gates and continuous integration, so that I can maintain code quality and deploy with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL run linting, testing, and formatting checks
2. WHEN changes are made THEN the system SHALL execute only affected project builds and tests
3. WHEN CI pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL support parallel execution with configurable concurrency
4. WHEN deployable services exist THEN the system SHALL build container images for affected services
5. WHEN quality gates fail THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and provide clear error messages

### Requirement 7: Container and Kubernetes Integration

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want seamless containerization and Kubernetes deployment, so that I can deploy applications consistently across environments.

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for establishing a comprehensive unit testing foundation for the AI-Native Monorepo Starter Kit. Currently, the project has minimal unit test coverage (~15%) with only basic setup and connection tests. This foundation will provide robust unit testing for all core business logic, shared libraries, domain entities, application services, and infrastructure components to achieve comprehensive code coverage and ensure code quality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for all domain entities and value objects, so that I can ensure business logic correctness and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN domain entities are created THEN the system SHALL validate all business rules and constraints
2. WHEN entity methods are called THEN the system SHALL test all possible execution paths and edge cases
3. WHEN value objects are instantiated THEN the system SHALL verify immutability and equality semantics
4. WHEN domain aggregates are modified THEN the system SHALL ensure consistency and invariant preservation
5. WHEN business policies are applied THEN the system SHALL validate correct rule enforcement
6. WHEN domain events are raised THEN the system SHALL verify proper event generation and data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for application services and use cases, so that I can ensure proper orchestration and business workflow execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN application services are invoked THEN the system SHALL test all use case scenarios and outcomes
2. WHEN dependencies are injected THEN the system SHALL verify proper dependency resolution and mocking
3. WHEN external services are called THEN the system SHALL test error handling and retry mechanisms
4. WHEN transactions are managed THEN the system SHALL verify proper commit and rollback behavior
5. WHEN validation occurs THEN the system SHALL test all validation rules and error responses
6. WHEN data transformation happens THEN the system SHALL verify correct mapping and conversion

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for shared library components, so that I can ensure reliable infrastructure and utility functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data access utilities are used THEN the system SHALL test all database operations and error scenarios
2. WHEN observability components are invoked THEN the system SHALL verify logging, metrics, and tracing functionality
3. WHEN vector database utilities are called THEN the system SHALL test all adapter methods and configurations
4. WHEN embedding services are used THEN the system SHALL verify embedding generation and quality
5. WHEN configuration utilities are accessed THEN the system SHALL test environment variable handling and defaults
6. WHEN utility functions are called THEN the system SHALL test all input combinations and edge cases

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test fixtures and mocking utilities, so that I can create isolated, repeatable, and maintainable unit tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test fixtures are created THEN the system SHALL provide reusable test data for all domain contexts
2. WHEN mocks are generated THEN the system SHALL create proper mock objects for all external dependencies
3. WHEN test setup occurs THEN the system SHALL provide consistent test environment initialization
4. WHEN test cleanup happens THEN the system SHALL ensure proper resource cleanup and state reset
5. WHEN test data is needed THEN the system SHALL provide factory methods for generating valid test objects
6. WHEN test isolation is required THEN the system SHALL prevent test interference and shared state issues

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and edge case testing, so that I can ensure robust system behavior under all conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid inputs are provided THEN the system SHALL test all validation error scenarios
2. WHEN external dependencies fail THEN the system SHALL verify proper error propagation and handling
3. WHEN resource constraints occur THEN the system SHALL test memory and performance limitations
4. WHEN concurrent operations happen THEN the system SHALL verify thread safety and race condition handling
5. WHEN network issues arise THEN the system SHALL test timeout and retry mechanisms
6. WHEN data corruption occurs THEN the system SHALL verify error detection and recovery procedures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage reporting and quality metrics, so that I can monitor and improve test effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL generate detailed coverage reports for all code paths
2. WHEN coverage analysis runs THEN the system SHALL identify untested code and missing test scenarios
3. WHEN test quality is measured THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on test effectiveness and maintainability
4. WHEN test performance is analyzed THEN the system SHALL report test execution times and bottlenecks
5. WHEN test results are generated THEN the system SHALL provide clear pass/fail reporting with detailed diagnostics
6. WHEN coverage thresholds are checked THEN the system SHALL enforce minimum coverage requirements

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want parameterized and property-based testing capabilities, so that I can test complex scenarios with comprehensive input variations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parameterized tests are defined THEN the system SHALL execute tests with multiple input combinations
2. WHEN property-based tests are created THEN the system SHALL generate random test inputs within specified constraints
3. WHEN edge cases are tested THEN the system SHALL automatically discover boundary conditions and corner cases
4. WHEN test data generation occurs THEN the system SHALL create realistic and diverse test scenarios
5. WHEN hypothesis testing is performed THEN the system SHALL verify system properties across input ranges
6. WHEN regression testing happens THEN the system SHALL maintain test cases that previously found bugs

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CI/CD integration for automated test execution, so that I can ensure continuous quality assurance and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL automatically execute all relevant unit tests
2. WHEN pull requests are created THEN the system SHALL run comprehensive test suites and report results
3. WHEN test failures occur THEN the system SHALL prevent code merging and provide detailed failure information
4. WHEN coverage drops THEN the system SHALL fail builds that don't meet minimum coverage thresholds
5. WHEN test performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert developers to slow or inefficient tests
6. WHEN test results are available THEN the system SHALL integrate with development tools and dashboards

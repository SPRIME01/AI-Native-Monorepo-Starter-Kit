# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for establishing comprehensive database integration testing for the AI-Native Monorepo Starter Kit. Currently, the project has minimal database testing with only basic connection validation. This framework will provide robust testing for all database operations, Supabase integration, vector database functionality, transaction management, data integrity, and performance characteristics to ensure reliable data layer functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive database connection and configuration testing, so that I can ensure reliable database connectivity and proper configuration management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database connections are established THEN the system SHALL test connection pooling and resource management
2. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL validate all database configuration parameters
3. WHEN connection failures occur THEN the system SHALL test retry mechanisms and error handling
4. WHEN multiple database instances are used THEN the system SHALL test connection routing and failover
5. WHEN environment changes occur THEN the system SHALL validate configuration updates and reconnection
6. WHEN connection limits are reached THEN the system SHALL test connection pool management and queuing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive CRUD operation testing for all data models, so that I can ensure proper data persistence and retrieval functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is inserted THEN the system SHALL validate proper record creation and constraint enforcement
2. WHEN data is queried THEN the system SHALL test all query patterns and result accuracy
3. WHEN data is updated THEN the system SHALL verify proper modification and version control
4. WHEN data is deleted THEN the system SHALL test soft delete and cascade operations
5. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN the system SHALL validate batch processing and performance
6. WHEN complex queries are executed THEN the system SHALL test joins, aggregations, and subqueries

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive transaction management testing, so that I can ensure data consistency and proper rollback behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transactions are started THEN the system SHALL test transaction isolation and locking behavior
2. WHEN transactions are committed THEN the system SHALL verify data persistence and consistency
3. WHEN transactions are rolled back THEN the system SHALL ensure complete state restoration
4. WHEN nested transactions are used THEN the system SHALL test savepoint management and rollback
5. WHEN concurrent transactions occur THEN the system SHALL test deadlock detection and resolution
6. WHEN distributed transactions are executed THEN the system SHALL validate two-phase commit protocols

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive vector database testing, so that I can ensure proper vector storage, retrieval, and similarity search functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vectors are stored THEN the system SHALL validate embedding dimension consistency and storage efficiency
2. WHEN similarity searches are performed THEN the system SHALL test search accuracy and performance
3. WHEN vector metadata is managed THEN the system SHALL verify proper indexing and retrieval
4. WHEN vector operations scale THEN the system SHALL test performance under increasing data volumes
5. WHEN vector database migrations occur THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and schema evolution
6. WHEN vector search parameters change THEN the system SHALL test result consistency and accuracy

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive data integrity and constraint testing, so that I can ensure proper data validation and business rule enforcement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data constraints are defined THEN the system SHALL test all constraint types and validation rules
2. WHEN referential integrity is enforced THEN the system SHALL validate foreign key relationships and cascades
3. WHEN unique constraints are applied THEN the system SHALL test duplicate prevention and error handling
4. WHEN check constraints are used THEN the system SHALL verify business rule enforcement and validation
5. WHEN data migration occurs THEN the system SHALL test constraint preservation and data consistency
6. WHEN constraint violations happen THEN the system SHALL validate proper error reporting and handling

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive database performance testing, so that I can ensure acceptable query performance and resource utilization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN queries are executed THEN the system SHALL measure and validate response times within acceptable limits
2. WHEN database load increases THEN the system SHALL test performance degradation and scaling behavior
3. WHEN complex queries are run THEN the system SHALL validate query optimization and execution plans
4. WHEN concurrent operations occur THEN the system SHALL test locking behavior and contention handling
5. WHEN database resources are monitored THEN the system SHALL track memory, CPU, and I/O utilization
6. WHEN performance baselines are established THEN the system SHALL detect performance regressions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive database migration and schema evolution testing, so that I can ensure safe database changes and version management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrations are applied THEN the system SHALL test forward migration execution and data preservation
2. WHEN migrations are rolled back THEN the system SHALL verify complete schema and data restoration
3. WHEN schema changes occur THEN the system SHALL validate backward compatibility and application integration
4. WHEN data transformations happen THEN the system SHALL test data migration accuracy and completeness
5. WHEN migration conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL test conflict detection and resolution mechanisms
6. WHEN migration performance is measured THEN the system SHALL validate execution time and resource usage

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test data management and isolation, so that I can create reliable and repeatable database tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test databases are created THEN the system SHALL provide isolated test environments for parallel execution
2. WHEN test data is seeded THEN the system SHALL generate realistic and consistent test datasets
3. WHEN tests run concurrently THEN the system SHALL prevent data interference and maintain isolation
4. WHEN test cleanup occurs THEN the system SHALL restore database state and remove all test data
5. WHEN test fixtures are used THEN the system SHALL provide reusable data setup and teardown utilities
6. WHEN test data factories are employed THEN the system SHALL generate valid test data for all scenarios

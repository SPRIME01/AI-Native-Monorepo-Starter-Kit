# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for establishing a comprehensive API testing framework for the AI-Native Monorepo Starter Kit. Currently, the project has minimal API testing coverage with only basic service stubs. This framework will provide robust testing for all FastAPI endpoints, HTTP request/response validation, authentication/authorization, error handling, and API contract verification to ensure reliable microservice communication and API quality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive HTTP endpoint testing for all FastAPI services, so that I can ensure proper API functionality and request/response handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTTP endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL test all supported HTTP methods and status codes
2. WHEN request payloads are sent THEN the system SHALL validate request schema and data validation
3. WHEN responses are returned THEN the system SHALL verify response schema and content accuracy
4. WHEN API routes are accessed THEN the system SHALL test all path parameters and query string handling
5. WHEN content negotiation occurs THEN the system SHALL verify proper content-type handling and serialization
6. WHEN API versioning is used THEN the system SHALL test backward compatibility and version-specific behavior

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive authentication and authorization testing, so that I can ensure proper security controls and access management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL test valid and invalid credential scenarios
2. WHEN JWT tokens are used THEN the system SHALL verify token validation, expiration, and refresh mechanisms
3. WHEN role-based access control is applied THEN the system SHALL test all permission combinations and restrictions
4. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL return proper 401 and 403 error responses
5. WHEN API keys are required THEN the system SHALL validate key authentication and rate limiting
6. WHEN session management is used THEN the system SHALL test session creation, validation, and cleanup

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and validation testing, so that I can ensure robust API behavior under all error conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid request data is sent THEN the system SHALL return proper 400 errors with detailed validation messages
2. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate 500 errors without exposing sensitive information
3. WHEN resources are not found THEN the system SHALL return proper 404 errors with helpful messages
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return 429 errors with retry information
5. WHEN request timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts gracefully with proper error responses
6. WHEN malformed requests are sent THEN the system SHALL validate and reject with appropriate error codes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API contract testing and schema validation, so that I can ensure API consistency and prevent breaking changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API schemas are defined THEN the system SHALL validate all requests and responses against OpenAPI specifications
2. WHEN API contracts change THEN the system SHALL detect breaking changes and compatibility issues
3. WHEN data models are updated THEN the system SHALL verify schema evolution and backward compatibility
4. WHEN API documentation is generated THEN the system SHALL ensure accuracy and completeness
5. WHEN contract testing runs THEN the system SHALL verify consumer-provider compatibility
6. WHEN API versioning occurs THEN the system SHALL validate version-specific contract compliance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance and load testing for API endpoints, so that I can ensure acceptable response times and system scalability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN single API requests are made THEN the system SHALL complete within acceptable response time limits
2. WHEN concurrent requests are processed THEN the system SHALL maintain performance under load
3. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN the system SHALL handle large payloads efficiently
4. WHEN stress testing is conducted THEN the system SHALL identify performance bottlenecks and limits
5. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN the system SHALL not exceed acceptable resource consumption
6. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL optimize query performance and connection usage

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive integration testing between microservices, so that I can ensure proper service communication and data flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services communicate THEN the system SHALL test all inter-service API calls and responses
2. WHEN data is exchanged THEN the system SHALL verify proper serialization and deserialization
3. WHEN service dependencies exist THEN the system SHALL test dependency injection and service discovery
4. WHEN distributed transactions occur THEN the system SHALL verify transaction consistency and rollback
5. WHEN event-driven communication happens THEN the system SHALL test message publishing and consumption
6. WHEN service failures occur THEN the system SHALL test circuit breaker and fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API testing automation and CI/CD integration, so that I can ensure continuous API quality and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL automatically execute all relevant API tests
2. WHEN API changes are made THEN the system SHALL run contract validation and breaking change detection
3. WHEN deployments occur THEN the system SHALL execute smoke tests and health checks
4. WHEN test failures happen THEN the system SHALL prevent deployments and provide detailed failure information
5. WHEN API monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL track API performance and availability metrics
6. WHEN test results are available THEN the system SHALL integrate with development dashboards and alerting

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test data management and environment isolation, so that I can create reliable and repeatable API tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test data is needed THEN the system SHALL provide factories for generating realistic API test data
2. WHEN tests run in parallel THEN the system SHALL isolate test data and prevent interference
3. WHEN test environments are set up THEN the system SHALL provide consistent and clean test environments
4. WHEN test cleanup occurs THEN the system SHALL remove all test data and restore initial state
5. WHEN database seeding is required THEN the system SHALL provide utilities for test data setup
6. WHEN external services are mocked THEN the system SHALL provide realistic mock responses and behavior

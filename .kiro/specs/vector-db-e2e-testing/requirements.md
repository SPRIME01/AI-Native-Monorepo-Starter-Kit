# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for comprehensive end-to-end testing of the vector database functionality in the AI-Native Monorepo Starter Kit. The current e2e test provides basic coverage but lacks comprehensive validation of error scenarios, business logic integration, and performance characteristics. This enhancement will ensure robust testing of the complete vector database pipeline from text input through embedding generation to similarity search results.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling tests for vector database operations, so that I can ensure the system gracefully handles invalid inputs and failure scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invalid embedding dimension is provided THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with descriptive message
2. WHEN malformed metadata is submitted THEN the system SHALL reject the request with validation errors
3. WHEN network connectivity fails THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts gracefully with appropriate error responses
4. WHEN authentication credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL return 401 unauthorized error
5. WHEN database connection is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return 503 service unavailable error
6. WHEN duplicate vector IDs are upserted THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts according to upsert semantics

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test the complete text-to-search pipeline integration, so that I can verify the end-to-end functionality works correctly with real business logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a text query is submitted THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings using the EmbeddingService
2. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL store them via the SupabaseVectorAdapter
3. WHEN similarity search is performed THEN the system SHALL use the SimilaritySearch class to orchestrate the query
4. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL include proper metadata and similarity scores
5. WHEN multiple text queries are processed THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency across operations
6. WHEN the complete pipeline executes THEN the system SHALL return results within acceptable time limits

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive data validation tests, so that I can ensure vector data integrity and search result quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN embeddings are stored THEN the system SHALL validate they have exactly 1536 dimensions
2. WHEN metadata is provided THEN the system SHALL validate required fields are present
3. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL include similarity scores between 0 and 1
4. WHEN large result sets are requested THEN the system SHALL implement proper pagination
5. WHEN vector data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL maintain precision of floating-point values
6. WHEN search queries specify top_k parameter THEN the system SHALL return exactly that number of results or fewer

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance and scalability tests for vector operations, so that I can ensure the system meets performance requirements under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN single vector upsert is performed THEN the system SHALL complete within 500ms
2. WHEN bulk vector upsert is performed THEN the system SHALL handle at least 100 vectors efficiently
3. WHEN similarity search is executed THEN the system SHALL return results within 1000ms
4. WHEN concurrent operations are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency
5. WHEN large embedding searches are conducted THEN the system SHALL not exceed memory limits
6. WHEN performance benchmarks are run THEN the system SHALL meet or exceed baseline metrics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage of the vector database adapter interface, so that I can ensure all adapter methods work correctly across different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN upsert method is called with valid data THEN the system SHALL store vectors successfully
2. WHEN query method is called with embedding vector THEN the system SHALL return relevant results
3. WHEN delete method is called with vector IDs THEN the system SHALL remove specified vectors
4. WHEN adapter methods encounter errors THEN the system SHALL propagate appropriate exceptions
5. WHEN multiple adapters are used THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent behavior
6. WHEN adapter configuration changes THEN the system SHALL reconnect properly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests with real embedding services, so that I can verify the system works with actual AI models rather than mock data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN real text is processed THEN the system SHALL generate meaningful embeddings
2. WHEN embeddings are compared THEN the system SHALL return semantically similar results
3. WHEN different embedding models are used THEN the system SHALL handle dimension variations
4. WHEN embedding service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle failures gracefully
5. WHEN embedding generation takes time THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate timeouts
6. WHEN embedding costs are incurred THEN the system SHALL track usage appropriately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive cleanup and isolation tests, so that I can ensure tests don't interfere with each other or leave residual data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL remove all test data automatically
2. WHEN tests run in parallel THEN the system SHALL isolate test data using unique identifiers
3. WHEN test failures occur THEN the system SHALL still perform cleanup operations
4. WHEN database state changes THEN the system SHALL restore initial state after tests
5. WHEN test data conflicts with existing data THEN the system SHALL use separate test namespaces
6. WHEN cleanup operations fail THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue with other cleanup tasks

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want monitoring and observability tests for vector operations, so that I can ensure proper logging and metrics collection during testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vector operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log appropriate debug information
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log error details with sufficient context
3. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL record timing and resource usage
4. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL emit success metrics
5. WHEN test runs execute THEN the system SHALL provide visibility into test progress
6. WHEN monitoring data is generated THEN the system SHALL format it for analysis tools

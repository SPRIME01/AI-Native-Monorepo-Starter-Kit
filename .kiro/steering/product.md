# Product Overview

## AI-Native Monorepo Starter Kit

This is a comprehensive monorepo starter kit designed for AI-native applications with a focus on:

- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Domain-driven design with clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure layers
- **Reversible Microservice Architecture**: Ability to extract contexts as microservices and merge them back to monolith with zero code impact
- **AI/ML Integration**: Built-in support for machine learning model lifecycle management, training, evaluation, and deployment
- **Vector Database Support**: Integrated Supabase with vector database capabilities for AI applications
- **Multi-language Support**: Python-first with TypeScript/JavaScript support via Nx workspace

## Key Capabilities

- **Domain Context Management**: Create and manage DDD contexts with proper hexagonal architecture
- **Service Architecture**: Split contexts into microservices or merge them back to monolith as needed
- **ML Model Lifecycle**: Train, evaluate, register, and promote ML models with canary deployments
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform and Ansible integration for cloud deployments
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker and Kubernetes support with auto-generated manifests
- **Development Workflow**: Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with quality gates

## Target Use Cases

- AI-powered applications requiring vector search and ML model management
- Domain-driven microservice architectures that need flexibility
- Rapid prototyping of AI-native applications
- Teams transitioning between monolith and microservice architectures

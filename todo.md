# ðŸŽ¯ Hexagonal Architecture Migration Plan

## âœ… Phase 1: Foundation Setup (COMPLETED)
- [x] Basic scaffolding system working
- [x] Domain structure created
- [x] Makefile commands functional
- [x] Cross-platform compatibility

## ðŸ”„ Phase 2: Enhanced Scaffolding (IN PROGRESS)
- [x] Update scaffold-apps to generate proper FastAPI interfaces
- [x] Update scaffold-domains to generate application services
- [x] Generate repository ports for each domain
- [x] Generate sample entities for each domain
- [x] Add dependency injection patterns
- [x] Clean existing structure and regenerate
- [x] Generate enhanced apps with proper FastAPI structure
- [x] Generate enhanced domains with hexagonal patterns
- [x] Create domain entities and services
- [x] Test new hexagonal structure

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: Core Domain Implementation
- [ ] Allocation domain: entities, services, ports
- [ ] Payments domain: entities, services, ports
- [ ] Invoicing domain: entities, services, ports
- [ ] Inventory domain: entities, services, ports
- [ ] Shipping domain: entities, services, ports
- [ ] Analytics domain: entities, services, ports

## ðŸ”§ Phase 4: Infrastructure Adapters
- [ ] Database adapters for each domain
- [ ] External API adapters
- [ ] File system adapters
- [ ] Message queue adapters

## ðŸš€ Phase 5: API Layer Enhancement
- [ ] Enhanced FastAPI apps with proper routing
- [ ] Request/response models
- [ ] Error handling middleware
- [ ] Health checks and monitoring

## ðŸ§ª Phase 6: Testing Framework
- [ ] Unit tests for domain entities
- [ ] Integration tests for services
- [ ] API endpoint tests
- [ ] Test data factories

## ðŸ“š Phase 7: Documentation
- [ ] Update README with hexagonal patterns
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Architecture decision records
- [ ] Development guidelines

## üìö Examples & Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Excellent Patterns

**File Operations**: Always read before editing and use context
```typescript
// Read current component structure first
const existingComponent = await readFile("./Component.tsx");
// Then make targeted changes with full context
```

**Code Reuse**: Leverage existing patterns
```typescript
// Use existing error handling pattern
import { handleApiError } from "./utils/errorHandler";
import { withTracing } from "./observability/decorators";
```

**Technical Debt Resolution**: Before and after examples
```typescript
// ‚ùå Before: Hardcoded values and no error handling
const API_URL = "https://api.example.com";
fetch(API_URL + "/users");

// ‚úÖ After: Environment config and proper error handling
import { API_BASE_URL } from "./config";
import { handleApiError } from "./utils/errorHandler";
import { withTracing } from "./observability/decorators";

@withTracing('user-service')
export class UserService {
  async getUsers() {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/users`);
      if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`API Error: ${response.status}`);
      return await response.json();
    } catch (error) {
      handleApiError(error);
    }
  }
}
```

**Domain-Driven Design**: Proper layer separation
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Domain Entity (pure business logic)
export class User {
  constructor(
    private readonly id: UserId,
    private readonly props: UserProps
  ) {}

  changeEmail(newEmail: Email): void {
    // Business rule validation
    if (!newEmail.isValid()) {
      throw new DomainError('Invalid email format');
    }
    this.props.email = newEmail;
  }
}

// ‚úÖ Application Service (orchestrates use cases)
export class UserService {
  constructor(
    private readonly userRepository: UserRepository,
    private readonly eventBus: EventBus
  ) {}

  async changeUserEmail(userId: UserId, newEmail: string): Promise<void> {
    const user = await this.userRepository.findById(userId);
    const email = Email.create(newEmail);

    user.changeEmail(email);
    await this.userRepository.save(user);

    this.eventBus.publish(new UserEmailChanged(userId, newEmail));
  }
}
```

**Reversible Microservice Pattern**: Service extraction
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Before extraction: In-process domain service
export class PaymentService {
  async processPayment(paymentRequest: PaymentRequest): Promise<PaymentResult> {
    // Direct domain service call
    return this.paymentDomain.processPayment(paymentRequest);
  }
}

// ‚úÖ After extraction: HTTP adapter maintaining same interface
export class PaymentHttpAdapter implements PaymentService {
  async processPayment(paymentRequest: PaymentRequest): Promise<PaymentResult> {
    const response = await fetch(`${this.serviceUrl}/payments`, {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(paymentRequest)
    });
    return response.json();
  }
}
```

**AI/ML Integration**: Model lifecycle management
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Model Service with proper lifecycle management
export class FraudDetectionService {
  constructor(
    private readonly modelRegistry: ModelRegistry,
    private readonly featureStore: FeatureStore
  ) {}

  async predict(transaction: Transaction): Promise<FraudScore> {
    const model = await this.modelRegistry.getActiveModel('fraud-detection');
    const features = await this.featureStore.getFeatures(transaction);

    return model.predict(features);
  }
}
```

### üó£Ô∏è Communication Best Practices

**Effective Clarification Requests**:
- "I see you want to add authentication. Do you mean JWT token-based auth or session-based auth?"
- "Your request mentions 'update service configuration' - are you referring to the Nx project.json, Docker configuration, or Kubernetes manifests?"
- "Should this new domain follow the existing hexagonal architecture pattern or do you need a different approach?"

**Architectural Guidance**:
- "For this payment processing feature, I recommend implementing it as a bounded context with proper domain events"
- "Given the complexity, let's extract this into a microservice using the reversible pattern"
- "This AI model integration would benefit from the established ML pipeline workflow"

### üöÄ Project-Specific Workflows

**Domain Creation**:
```bash
# 1. Generate domain structure
make domain-create name=user-management

# 2. Implement hexagonal layers
# - Domain entities and value objects
# - Application services and use cases
# - Infrastructure adapters and repositories

# 3. Add observability and testing
# - Tracing decorators
# - Unit and integration tests
# - Performance monitoring
```

**Service Extraction**:
```bash
# 1. Analyze domain dependencies
make domain-analyze name=payments

# 2. Extract to microservice
make service-extract context=payments transport=http

# 3. Deploy and monitor
make service-deploy context=payments
make service-monitor context=payments
```

**AI/ML Development**:
```bash
# 1. Create model context
make model-create context=fraud-detection type=classification

# 2. Train and evaluate
make model-train context=fraud-detection
make model-evaluate context=fraud-detection

# 3. Deploy and monitor
make model-deploy context=fraud-detection env=production
make model-monitor context=fraud-detection
```
